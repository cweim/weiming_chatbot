In 2020, there were 4,029 recorded abortions, averaging 336 per month, some involving underage girls. These challenges exacerbate the nation's aging population and endanger maternal and fetal health.\n\n**Key Challenges:**\n\n- **Access to Support:** How can we make it easier for women facing unplanned pregnancies to access personalised assistance, connect with professional counselors, and receive necessary emotional support without overwhelming or complicating the process?\n- **Streamlining Services:** How can we streamline the handling of inquiries and prioritize cases effectively without compromising service quality or burdening administrators with complex features?\n\n**Our Role:** With a team of six, we aimed to unify information from independent help centers and the government, providing a comprehensive support system for those in need. Our focus was on simplifying access to resources, improving case management, and ensuring the delivery of compassionate, effective care.\n\n",

The goal was to address client concerns and reflect SUTD’s identity.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- **Client Requirements:** Focused on issues such as ease of entry and exit, designing features like armrests and side compartments for both front and rear seats, and a leg and heel rest for the driver. These features included step platforms and handles to facilitate access for elderly passengers and children.\n- **Design Development:** Over 14 weeks, our team produced a vision render for the EVAM’s interior and developed physical prototypes of the steering wheel, dashboard UI, and screens for both driver and passenger.\n\n**My Deliverables**:\n\n- **Design Solutions:** Addressed key issues by designing practical components to improve vehicle accessibility and comfort.\n- **Prototyping:** Developed physical prototypes of the steering wheel, and passenger and driver screens.\n\n**Learning Outcomes:**\n\n- Emphasised the importance of storyboarding to effectively communicate ideas.\n- Gained experience in hand sketching for initial ideation, producing numerous quick sketches to explore concepts.\n- Created a mood board to establish the design tone, feel, and identity, ensuring uniformity across all components.\n\n",

Our team reimagined the station's layout from an architectural perspective to enhance movement efficiency. We focused on optimising human traffic flow during peak periods.\n\nI led the 3D modelling process, using Fusion 360 to bring our team's ideas to life. This involved multiple iterations to refine the design and address potential flaws. Once finalised, I developed the physical prototype. While our design may not be implemented, it serves as a valuable reference for future train station designs globally.\n\n",

Established to guide Singapore's physical development, URA is tasked\nwith formulating strategies that address the country's land constraints while ensuring sustainable\ngrowth and liveability. Over the years, URA has played a pivotal role in shaping Singapore’s\ntransformation into a modern, vibrant, and highly liveable city-state. Its efforts are guided by a\nlong-term vision to balance economic development, environmental sustainability, and quality of\nlife. URA’s work spans various domains, including urban planning, heritage conservation,\ninfrastructure development, and placemaking initiatives.\nURA’s approach to urban planning is underpinned by a data-driven and community-centered\nphilosophy. Through careful consideration of current and future trends, URA crafts development\nstrategies that address pressing challenges such as housing needs, mobility, and climate\nresilience. By integrating innovative solutions into its planning processes, URA ensures that\nSingapore remains adaptable to global changes while continuing to thrive as a competitive and\ninclusive city.\n1.2 Public Engagement Session\nURA leverages the Master Plan as a statutory land-use blueprint to guide Singapore’s\ndevelopment over the medium to long term, typically spanning 10 to 15 years. The Master Plan’s\nprimary objective is to optimize limited land resources, supporting sustainable growth while\nenhancing the living environment for residents. Reviewed every five years, this dynamic plan\ntranslates long-term strategies into actionable, detailed development plans.\nPublic engagement is an integral part of URA’s planning process. Through these sessions, URA\ngathers insights, feedback, and aspirations from the community to ensure that urban development\naligns with the needs and desires of residents, businesses, and other stakeholders. These sessions\nact as a bridge between planners and the public, fostering dialogue and mutual understanding.\nPublic engagement sessions not only provide a platform for participants to voice concerns and\nshare ideas but also encourage collaboration in the design of urban spaces. By involving diverse\ncommunity groups, URA ensures inclusivity, amplifying under-represented voices in the\nplanning process. This participatory approach cultivates a sense of ownership and belonging\namong residents, strengthening their connection to their living spaces.\nThe insights and feedback collected during these sessions play a crucial role in shaping URA’s\npolicies and projects. They help ensure that the Master Plan remains responsive to the evolving\n",

Open AI DALL·E 2\n\nAfter encountering the limitations with the Hugging Face Diffusers, we decided to test Open AI’s\nDALL.E 2.

This approach promised a more accessible API and simplified the\ncomputational requirements, making it a suitable candidate for scalable and user-friendly\napplications.\nTo implement inpainting using DALL·E 2, we leveraged Open AI's Python API. The process\ninvolved uploading a square Portable Network Graphics (PNG) image as the base, and an alpha\nchannel mask to indicate the areas for modification (transparent regions signifying the editable\nparts). Along with these inputs, a descriptive text prompt detailing the desired edits was\nprovided. The API processed the inputs and returned a URL to the edited image.\nHowever, the quality of DALL.E 2’s outputs was not as expected. For simple scenes, it produced\nacceptable results, but for complex scenes, it often failed to deliver with most generations turning\nblanks or with random artifacts.\n",

URA had previously engaged residents and stakeholders to explore ideas for\ntransforming the sheltered viaduct space below the Queensway Flyover into a new community\nnode.\nFollowing confirmation of the site, a site visit was conducted to analyze the area and its\nsurroundings. This included observing existing features, assessing accessibility, and\nunderstanding the current use of space to inform the application testing process.\nThe location is part of the Alexandra-Queensway Park Connector, which serves as a vital link\nconnecting nearby HDB estates to the Rail Corridor. The space is situated beneath a highway,\nfunctions as an underpass that facilitates accessibility and encourages active mobility, offering a\nseamless connection in the direction towards Tanjong Pagar and Woodlands.\n4.2 Choosing of Participants for the Engagement\nTo ensure a diverse and representative group, participants were selected across various\ndemographics, including age, gender, and background. The group ranged from university\nstudents to elderly residents, providing valuable insights into the differing needs, perspectives,\nand expectations of users across generations. This approach ensured that the feedback collected\nwas inclusive and reflective of the broader community's interests.\n4.3 Hosting of the Engagement\nThe application was tested during an in-person session with eight people, held at the URA\nbuilding. Due to timetable clashes within the participants, the team was not able to hold this\nevent in the actual engagement site.\nIn-Person Session\nThe application testing was conducted through an in-person session involving a total of eight\nparticipants.

Most notably, user\nsatisfaction metrics showed a marked improvement, with the AI application scoring 5.0\ncompared to 4.0 for the conventional method. The intuitiveness ratings remained relatively\nconsistent between both approaches, with scores of 4.8 and 4.6 respectively, indicating that users\nfound both methods similarly approachable.\nA particularly significant finding emerged in the Expectation fulfillment category, where the AI\napplication achieved a score of 4.7 compared to 2.8 for the conventional method, representing a\nsubstantial 68% increase. This dramatic improvement suggests that the new methodology better\naligns with user requirements and anticipated outcomes.\nEngagement and Retention Metrics\nThe AI solution dramatically exceeded expectations, scoring 4.7 compared to 2.8 for the\nconventional method, showing just how much better it met users' needs and delivered on their\nexpectations.\nUsers found themselves far more drawn in and committed to the AI-powered approach. Perfect\nscores in flexibility and engagement (5.0) showed how much more intuitive and engaging it was\ncompared to traditional methods, which scored 3.9 and 4.3 respectively. The user retention\nmetric also saw an impressive jump to 4.6 from 3.3, highlighting how the AI solution not only\nkept users far more invested in the process and willing to return.\nIn particular, one aspect that surprised us was the significant jump in output quality, from 3.3 for\nthe conventional method to a 4.6/5 for our AI application. This surprised us as we used a more\ncapable AI image generation model in the conventional workflow. Yet participants ranked the AI\napplication’s outputs as a higher quality. We think this can be attributed to several process\ninnovations involved in the AI application, such as the prompt upscaling and user persona\nfeedback mechanisms, that helped our users better conceptualise and execute on their individual\nvisions.\n",

They actively explored the process and\nwere eager to understand its features. In contrast, participants using the conventional workflow\ndisplayed less enthusiasm, appearing more reserved and passive throughout the session.\nDiving deeper into the various age groups, the team has observed that the older folks tend to be\nvery focused on the application and have lesser in-person verbal engagement. As most of them\nhave not been exposed to AI, they tended to feel a bit of stress and confusion, which distracts\nthem from the aim of discussing their generations with their peers.\nOn the other hand, the younger participants who have already had experience prompting and\ngenerating images, tend to be more social with their peers. They enjoy sharing what they have\ngenerated, and are curious as to how varying the prompts can produce very different results.\nInterviews\nAs each method’s session concluded earlier than expected, participants were introduced to the\nalternative workflow they had not tried. This allowed us to gather comparative feedback directly.\nOne participant noted that the conventional method fosters group interaction, as participants sit\ntogether, share ideas, and broaden their perspectives. The final result—such as a generated\nimage—felt like a collective effort, reflecting input from multiple participants.\nIn contrast, the AI application workflow was described as more direct and site-specific. Its core\nfunctionality, particularly in imprinting, ensured that the generated images were well-suited to\nthe intended site. Participants appreciated this as the primary differentiator.

Singapore Universityof Technologyand Design 60.002:AIApplicationsin Design Dr.Kwan Wei Lek,Dr Edwin Koh,Mr Michael Alexander Reeves April16,2023 [PAGE BREAK] 1.Introduction In recent times, technology has been advancing at a rapid rate and in recent times,there has been a sudden boom in interesttowards Artificial Intelligenceand Machine Learning.Thisisnotunexpected given how society is progressing towards digitization where more and more people are becoming glued to their smartphones,beittobrowsethroughsocialmedia,doingonlineshoppingetc.Withthis immense surge of people going online, there is also a huge amount of data being uploaded every single second, and these data are the honeypots of feedback and consumer taste and preferences wheremanycompanieswouldbeinterestedinobtainingtodeveloptheirproduct. However, the issue lies with the immense amount of data online, how are we able todiscernwhatis relevant and irrelevant to what the companies are focusing on for design improvements. In this project we will be exploring and categorising largequantitiesofdataextractedfromonlineplatforms throughtheuseof Artificial Intelligencetofindpossibledesignimprovementsofaproduct. 1.1 Reasonforchoosingthe Nothing Phone(1) We have chosen to implement AI machine learning on the Nothing Phone (1), a phone that was announced in January in 2021 and released in July 2022. It was a highly anticipated phone that circulated a lot of discussions among the technology geek community, and the general view for this phone is that it is very controversial in thesensewhereitisnothinglikewehaveseenbefore.People were excited for the final reveal and release of the phone back in July 2022, but just to be disappointedonhowitactuallycameout. The company that came out with this product is called ‘Nothing’. This company was foundedon29 October 2020, so it's still a relatively newcompanywhencomparedtootherphonecompanies.Asof March 2023, the company has only released 4 products, 3 ofwhicharewirelessearbuds,andthelast product being a smartphone. Being a product which does not have a subsequent model, there are bound to be issues that the smartphone faces when used by consumers in the mass. Thus, our group decidedtorideontheopportunityandfocuson Nothing Phone(1). One application we can implement AI and machine learning is what we will be exploring in this project where we would be utilising machine learning models tofindroomsforimprovementsofthe product Nothing Phone(1). We have chosen to find design opportunities and improvements on “Nothing Phone 1” asitgotalot oftractionduringitsprereleaseduetoitsuniquedesign.However,afteritgotreleasedtherewasalot of bad feedback.

You Tube Data Extraction: Before we are able to extract data from youtube, we have to set up the You Tube Data API.APIsare unique to every individual’s google account. Itisneededforustobeabletoaccessallyoutube’sdata forexamplevideos,comments,titlesandmanymoreofyoutube’sdata. The first step of extracting youtube data is first to specify what is the search terms that you are searching for, which in our case will be the ‘nothing phone (1)’.Nextistospecifyhowmanyvideos do you want the code to run through under the variable “max_results”. Afterwhich the code will essentially iterate through each video’s comments, and even furthermore each comment’s replies. Whichallthesesentenceswillbeappendedonebyonetoaninitiallyemptylist. We utilised the pandas Dataframe to store each of the comments with the list of comments formed when running the code. And saved it as a csv file in the end to avoid needing to run it again in the futureasthiscodetakesawhiletofinishrunning.

Tokenisation 2. Removalof Stopwords 3. Lemmatization 4. Splitneutralterms 5. Languagesplit 6. Remove1 wordcomments The code for the data cleaning is all in the “Clean_data.py” code folder. Our inputs for this process will be the extracted comments CSV file from our data collection process. In the code, all these functions would run on the same file but we will be going in depth to what each of these cleaning functionsdoesandthejustificationindoingso. 2.1 Tokenisation,Removalstopwords,Lemmatization Tokenization is the first step to do when doing data cleaning, it splits the comments into individual words or terms called tokens. It is an important first step in data preprocessing as it is required for lemmatization. Lemmatization is used to remove inflection by determining the part of speech and utilising a detailed database of the language, reducing a given word to its root meaning to identify similarities e.g. from ‘better’ to ‘good’, it derives the meaning of a word from a dictionary. The function ‘Lemmastise_sentence’ tokenise the sentences and lemmatises it and then joins the words backtogether. Stopwords are frequent words used in the english language that do not have specific semanticssuch as “the”,”is” etc, removing them prevents common words from showing up forcommonwordsused during the data analysis step such as when we wish to detect the most used word. The function “remove_stop_words”identifiesnon-semanticwordsandremovesthemfromthesentences.Doingall ofthiswillincreasesearchperformanceastherearelesserwordstoprocess. It is important to note that we also remove the words “nothing”, “phone”, “1”, and “one” fromeach sentence in the data too. Reason being wepredictthatthesewordswillaffectourresultwhenfinding out the words that appear the most in thelaterstage.Asoursearchtermis“nothingphone(1)”,most comments describing this product will have a high probability of having the name of the product in their sentences too. So in order to avoid the top words being the name of theproduct,wedecidedto removethenameoftheproductinourdata. [PAGE BREAK] 2.3 Removalofemojis,links,duplicatedcommentsandlowercasingwords Links, emojis and duplicated/repeated comments are then removed from our dataset through the “clean_comment()” function. These are removed as it will not be relevanttous;althoughemojiscan give us an emotion towards something, it will not beabletoprovideusexactdetailsinwhattheyare reacting to, i.e. what specifications, hence we remove it as it will bedifficulttoobtainspecifications fromthat. As we are focusing on text emojis, we cannot really discern much from emojis so we will be removing it to reduce our data. Additionally, links incommentswouldnotberelevanttoourprojects asmostofthemwouldbeforadvertisement.whichisnotusefulforourproject. We also used the pandas dataframe’s drop_duplicate() function to remove all the entries that were repeated. And later on resetting the index of the pandas dataframe to make it easiertovisualisehow manyentriesareleftinthedataframe. We also converted all characters inthedatatobelowercase.Thisissothattherewontbeanyerrorof upper and lower case when we try to search for any specific words within a comment in the later stage. Therefore we standardise for every single character of every comment in the data to be lowercase. 2.4 Splitneutralterms We also have split long balanced comments with neutral words like 'but' and ‘however’' to rule out the comments that are neutral, essentially splitting up one long comment into 2 comments; positive andnegative. We proceeded to ask Chatgpt what are the possible words or terms that can make a sentence sound neutral. We then check if any comments consistofanyoftheseneutralwords,andifthereis,wewill splitthesentencewiththatword.Belowisapictureofchatgpt’sresponseoftheneutralterms. 2.5 Removalofnon-englishcomments After this, in the dataframe of comments, we added another column named “language”. In this column, essentially we used the function detect() from the langdetect library in python, so that it is [PAGE BREAK] able to go through each sentence in the dataframe to determine whatlanguageitisin,andlabeleach sentence’slanguageinthecolumn“language”. After we have a column of language labels for each sentence, we proceed to onlytakethesentences whichareonlyclassifiedas Englishtomovefurtherintoourproject. 2.6 Remove1 wordcomments This step is the last step of our data cleaning. How wedecidedtoremovethe1 wordedentriesinthe data is because when we looked at the data, we realisedthattheseonewordingwillnotgiveusgood informationregardinghowtoimprovetheproduct. Take for example in the data there is the entry“battery”.Withoutanymorewords,wewilldefinitely be able to deduce whether this is a positive or negative comment.

Given that we have 29155 comments, we do not have the time and resourcestorunitforallofthesecommentsasweestimatedthetimetakenforall29155 commentsto beanalysedbythemodelisaround22 hours. Therefore, we decided to randomise our comments from Youtube and Reddit and randomly picked out 15% of the data. Leaving us with a sampleof3340 commentsfromthehuge29155 commentsof the original dataset. Webelievethatthisisasmartmoveasitwillhugelyreducethehoursrequiredto do the analysis and classification of our data and we believe that it will not affect the final result of our project. But we noted that inanidealsituation,weshouldrunallofthedataintothemodeltoget the maximal possible accurate final output of the project given that we have enoughtimeandstrong enoughcomputerstorunthecomputations. For this part of the project, we did research and decided to try 4 models on our dataset.Namely,the Siebert Sentiment Analysis and Zero shot classification which we retrieved from a website called huggingface,Vader Analysis,aswellastopicmodelling. [PAGE BREAK] 3.1 Siebert Sentiment Analysis To run the Siebert Sentiment Analysis onourdatasetusingthehuggingfacewebsite,ourpythoncode uses a pipeline to connect the huggingface model to our code. There also is a function called analyze_sentiment(comment) so that we can iterate through all comments and pass it on to this function for analysis. The function will then analyse whether a comment is positive or negative and labelitinanewdataframecolumnaseither“POSITIVE”or“NEGATIVE”. 3.2 VADERmodel At the same time, we have decided to use the VADER model which is an alternative to Sentiment Analysis that is more suitable in discerning social media comments . It is during this process we realised that the VADER modeltooklessertimeinclassifyingthesentimentvalueshencewedecided to run our full Dataset through it (29155). The key difference in terms of output is that this model classifiedtheneutralcommentsaswell. 3.3 Extractingnegativesentimentcommentsfromboth VADERand Siebert Sentiment Analysis Comparing the 2 modelswhichcandothesamethingcanbedoneverydifferently.Wedecidedtouse Siebert's Sentiment Analysisfromhuggingfaceover Vader.Herearethereasonswhy. 1. As seen in the figure below, Siebert’s Sentiment Analysis is able to identify more negative comments in the dataset and Vader actually classified the least negative comments on the other hand. Looking at this bar chart, we deduced that Siebert is able to analyse a comment betterthan Vader,whichiswhy Siebert’smodelwilltakealongertimetorun. 2. Siebert Sentiment Analysis is a deep learning model, which means it is able to analyse commentsmoreaccurately. 3. Too manycommentsthatwentthroughthe Vadermodelareclassifiedas Neutral.Becausewe believe that we already successfully ruled out all the neutral comments in the cleaning data part of the process. Therefore the fact that so many comments are still classified as neutral tellsusthatthe Vadermodelmaynotbesuitabletouseinourcase. Therefore moving on further into our project, we utilised the data that ran through the Siebert Sentiment Analysis model. The output after running this model is a column in our dataframe, indicating whether that comment is a positive comment “POSITIVE” or a negative comment “NEGATIVE”. We then took out all thecommentsthatwerelabelledas“NEGATIVE”becausethese will be the comments that will be more valuable to us when deducing the finaldesignrequirements.

Figure:Comparing VADERand SAmodels 3.5 Topic Modelling This model is actually suggested by Chatgpt. Upon finalising our work plan for this project, we wondered if there is any other way we could go about this project in a better way. So we turned to Chat GPT.Belowisascreenshotofourconversationwith Chat GPT.

Finding Nothing Phone’sownidentityinthesmartphonemarket There are many comments on how the Nothing Phone (1) is highly similar in terms of looks to the i Phone, with some people even calling it a cheap version of the i Phone. As seen in the Wordcloud image for ‘Features’, “iphone” is one of the top 3 words that were mentioned in the comments. The fact that most comments referred to the i Phonejustgoestoshowthatthe Nothing Phone(1)doesnot have a trademark of its own that peoplecaninstantlylinktothe Nothingcompanyimmediatelyupon seeing one of its products. For example, the i Phones are recognised for their flat edged bezel, while the Samsung Galaxy series are known for their curved edged screens.

Summaryoflessonlearnt To conclude our report, we will be sharing a summary of our lessons learnt when doingthisproject, andwouldwehavedonedifferentlyifweevercomeacrossasimilarprojectagain. [PAGE BREAK] 1. Deeperresearchoneachmodel’salgorithm. In our project, we rely heavily on existing models and what we did essentially isonlytoapplythem without cleaned data. While we did some experiments and hadourowninterpretationofwhycertain models are better and certain models are worse. A lesson learnt is to do more thorough research on the models that may be useful to our project, and study its algorithm answer the question of, will it take longer to run?, how is it classifying certain things?, how does it deal with bad and irrelevant data?, is it really suitable for comments/reviews classification or is it actually more for essays or articles? 2. Datacleaningisnotalinearprocess,butmoreofatrialanderrorprocess. When we were doing our data cleaning, it was an iterative process. Reason being it was a constant process of us completing one part of the cleaning, then checking manually on the data itself to identify what could be done better to the data. Take for example when we realised that there were a lot of random 39 s in our dataset which needed toberemoved,whenwerealisedonewordcomments were invaluable for our study, and when we found out that some comments were repeated or non english comments. It was an iterative process of checking the data,findingoutwhatwaswrongwith it, and coming with the code to clean it more thoroughly. So do not expectthecleaningdataprocess tobeaoneshotfinishedprocess. 3. Differentsourcesfordifferentproducts For different products that you are interested to do more research on,therewillbedifferentwebsites that have more data on certain products.

So it is importanttonotethatfordifferentproducts,wecannotusethesamesources as some products may be more popular in some sources and some products may be less popular in some sources. Some of the keyfactorsweidentifywitharebecausesomesocialsources,forexample youtube/facebook/instagram, have very different users. For example facebook users are normally older people, instagram users are normally more of a teenage person. Therefore the topics that the users discuss in both these apps will be very different.

Results and Discussion 21 References 23 [PAGE BREAK] 1. Introduction Accurately predicting stock prices’ rise and fall has long been a dream of traders and researchers alike. The instantaneous nature of Twitter means that people's sentiments may be felt directly on stock prices, which created a new prediction layer. Elon Musk's announcement of Tesla's privatization and Kylie Jenner's comment on Snapchat both had dramatically impacted the stock prices of the twocompanies. Inrecentyears,withtheadvancementin NLP,suchas Fin BERT, people have tried to incorporate public and/or professional sentiments into stock price prediction. Forinstance,Mehtab&Sen(2019)attemptedtopredictthemovementof NIFTY 50 index 1 week into the future based on Twitter sentiments using an LSTM model, while Sonkiya et al (2021) used GAN and BERT to predict the price of Apple Inc. (ticker symbol: AAPL) 5, 15, and 30 days into the future. Besides Twitter, which reflects the views of the public and influencers, some such as Puh & Babac (2023) also used professional views from the Wall Street Journal to predict the stock market. However, we found that existing literature has largely focused on the movement of stock prices multiple days into the future, which is at odds with the common tradingpracticeofdaytradingatfinancialinstitutions. Hence,ourprojectwould like to focus on developing a model to predict the movement of stocks within the trading day based on public sentiments i.e., tweets and market information. 2. Methodology 2.1. Workflow To explore the impact of sentiment analysis on stock price prediction, we devel- oped two workflows: a baseline version and an enhanced version, which includes additional data. Asshowninthefigurebelow,thebaselineworkflowhasthreemaincomponents: a datasetcomposedoftweets,sentimentanalysisofthesetweets,andaclassification model to predict stock price movements. [PAGE BREAK] To broaden our exploration of stock indicators, we've expanded our dataset to include news articles and fine-tuned the Financial BERT (Fin BERT) Model. These improvements aim to increase the accuracy of our sentiment analysis within the updated workflow, as displayed in the diagram below. 2.2. Dataset 2.2.1. Dataset Collection As outlined in the workflow diagram presented in the previous section, we utilize five distinct sub-datasets. Each dataset has a specific source and purpose as detailed below. [PAGE BREAK] 1. stock_market_tweets Source: \"mjw/stock_market_tweets\" from Hugging Face Description: This dataset consists of tweets specifically related to stocks, including text content and additional details such as the number of retweets, likes, and comments. 2. stock_information Source: Scraped from Nasdaq Description: Information about stocks including details about their country, sector, and industry. 3. news Source: \"ashraq/financial-news\" from Hugging Face Description: A collection of financial news headlines. 4. twitter_financial_news_sentiment Source: \"zeroshot/twitter-financial-news-sentiment\" from Hug- ging Face Description: An English corpus of finance-related tweets anno- tated for sentiment, used to fine-tune the Fin Bert model. 5. Yahoo_Finance_OHLC_stock Source: Extracted using Yahoo Python API Description: Stock price information, specifically Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) data. 2.2.2. Dataset Manipulation Thedatasets'stock_market_tweets'and'stock_information'aremergedthrough an inner join operation on the stock symbol. In the case of the 'news' dataset, which lacks a specific column identifying the relevant stock, we first compile a list of distinct company names from 'stock_information'. We then attempt to extract patterns of these company names from the news headlines. Afterpredictingandaggregatingsentimentscores,thedatasets'stock_market_tweets', 'news', and 'Yahoo_Finance_OHLC_stock' are merged together based on the stock name and date information. Further details about the sentiment aggregation process will be discussed in the following section. 2.3. Sentiment Analysis We selected the pretrained Fin BERT model, 'ahmedrachid/Financial BERT- Sentiment-Analysis,' to serve both as the tokenizer and the prediction model. Thistransformer-based modeloutperforms traditional BERT models inhandling financial texts. Optimized specifically for financial contexts, the sentiment labels aredesignatedasfollows: thepositivelabelsuggestsa'buy'action,zeroindicates 'do nothing,' and the negative label advises to 'sell'. [PAGE BREAK] 2.3.1. Fine-tuning In the baseline architecture, the model was not fine-tuned. However, for the enhanced version, we fine-tuned the model using 11,931 labeled financial tweets from the 'twitter_financial_news_sentiment' dataset. The training parameters employed were as follows: learning_rate=2 e-5, per_device_train_batch_size=16, per_device_eval_batch_size=16, num_train_epochs=20, weight_decay=0.01, evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\", save_strategy=\"epoch\", metric_for_best_model='accuracy' In addition, we quantified the effects of preprocessing steps, which included removing repeated punctuations, cleaning hashtags, and replacing URLs with the '[URL]' token. As shown in the table, the sentiment prediction accuracy on the test dataset remains relatively consistent, both before and after fine-tuning. This indicates the tokenizer's effectiveness in handling messy text.

Tweets Given the large volume of tweets related to each stock on any given day, it becomes necessary to aggregate the respective sentiment scores to obtain a coherent overall sentiment. Furthermore, to gauge the social impact of specific tweets, we also consider engagement metrics to measure the public influence exerted by each tweet. The sentiment score, however, originally a categorical variable with three labels (0 for negative, 1 for neutral, and 2 for positive), is not directly suitable for multiplication with quantitative metrics like retweet counts, like counts, or comment counts, as this operation lacks intuitive sense with categorical labels.

This method involves mapping the sentiment categories to numerical values: [PAGE BREAK] sentiment_weights = {0: -1, 1: 0, 2: 1} • 0 represents negative sentiment (assigned a weight of -1) • 1 represents neutral sentiment (assigned a weight of 0) • 2 represents positive sentiment (assigned a weight of 1) The formula for weighted average score calculation: This formula calculates the weighted average of sentiment scores, taking into account the weights provided by the retweet counts, like counts, and comment counts for each tweet. 2.2.2.2. News Headlines Fornewsitems, wecalculatetheaveragesentiment scoreofallheadlinesrelatedtoaspecificstockonthesameday. Additionally,we include an average sentiment score for news related to the stock's industry, thus incorporating an industry sentiment indicator. This dual-layered approach helps provide a broader perspective on the sentiment influencing both the specific stock and its wider industry. 2.2.2.3. Integrated Dataset for Predicting Stock Price Movements The aggregated sentiment scores from tweets and news are combined with the OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) pricing data based on stock name and tickers. The resulting dataset, prepared for stock price prediction, includes the following columns: • post_date • ticker_symbol • Country • IPO Year • Sector • Industry • Open • High • Low • Close • Adj Close • Volume • Shifted_Open [PAGE BREAK] • Shifted_Adj Close • Shifted_Close • prev_day_Open • prev_day_Open_Adj Close • prev_day_Close • news_sentiment • industry_sentiment • weighted_tweet_sentiment 2.4. Data Pre-processing 2.4.1. Motivation The data preprocessing consists of five major tasks, i.e., data cleaning, reduction, scaling, transformation and partitioning (Xiao and Fan, 2014; Fan et al., 2015 a; Fan et al., 2015 b) . These techniques effectively address inconsistencies, redundancies, and irrele- vant information within the data, ultimately enhancing data quality and model accuracy (Gandomi and Haider, 2015) 2.4.2. Methodologies The techniques we used to preprocess the dataset, ensures its compatibility with various machine learning models. Through a series of strategies, the raw data underwent preprocessing to enhance its usability and effectiveness in subsequent modeling tasks. 2.4.2.1. Data cleaning We clean the data to handle missing data effec- tively. Initially, missing values were addressed using the forward fill method (method='ffill') to propagate non-null values forward along the specified axis. Subsequently, rows with missing values in critical columns such as 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', and 'Adj Close' were removed using the ‘dropna’ method. This ensured that the dataset was cleansed of incomplete or erroneous records, facilitating robust analysis and a viable dataset for training the models. Inaddition,arollingaccumulationofsentimentscoreswasperformedtoaugment the dataset's richness. This process involved carrying forward and averaging sentiment scores in rows where price columns contained missing values. By aligning sentiment scores with price data through this rolling accumulation, the dataset's temporal coherence was maintained, facilitating a more comprehensive analysis of market sentiment trends. [PAGE BREAK] 2.4.2.2. Data transformation The dataset was restructured into numerical andcategoricaltoensurethatdifferenttypesoffeaturesareappropriatelyhandled during preprocessing. Categorical features : ['ticker_symbol', 'Country', 'IPO Year', 'Sector', 'Industry'], within the dataset were transformed into a numerical representation to make them compatible with machine learning algorithms. This transformation was achieved through label encoding, wherein each categorical feature's values were converted into numerical labels using the Label Encoder module from the scikit-learn library. By encoding categorical variables into numerical form, the dataset was prepared for subsequent analysis and model training. A new binary target variable, denoted as 'y', was generated to facilitate binary classification. This variable was derived from the 'Close' and 'Open' price columns, where 'y' was assigned a value of 1 if the 'Close' price was greater than the 'Open' price, indicating a positive price change. Conversely, 'y' was assignedavalueof0 ifthe'Close'pricewaslessthanorequaltothe'Open'price, indicating a negative or neutral price change. This labeling process enhanced the dataset's suitability for binary classification tasks. 2.4.2.3. Data scaling To ensure consistency in feature scales and facilitate convergence during model training, numerical features underwent scaling. The Min-Max scaling technique was employed, which rescales each feature to a specified range (typically 0 to 1) using the Min Max Scaler module from scikit- learn. By scaling numerical features, the dataset's features were normalized, preventing features with larger scales from dominating the learning process. 2.5. Model 2.5.1. Objective We follow a typical day trading scenario, in which all positions are closed before the trading day to minimize risks and price change after the market closes. The decision to long, in anticipation of an increase in the stock price, or short, in anticipation of an decrease, is made at the opening of a day’s market, with the stock being sold or bought at the closing to close the position. Therefore, our algorithm attempts at answering the classification problem: will thestock’sclosingpricebehigherthantheopeningprice,givenhistoricalmarket [PAGE BREAK] data and recent tweets & news about the company and/or industry? 2.5.2. Evaluation Methodology In our evaluation methodology, we will utilize different metrics depending on the target variable type. For continuous, we employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) (Hyndman & Athanasopoulos, 2014). MSE measures the average squared differencebetweenpredictedandactualvalues,withlower MSEindicatingbetter model performance for continuous prediction tasks. For discrete (classification tasks), we use a combination of metrics. Firstly , we look towards accuracy measurement, the ratio",

MSE measures the average squared differencebetweenpredictedandactualvalues,withlower MSEindicatingbetter model performance for continuous prediction tasks. For discrete (classification tasks), we use a combination of metrics. Firstly , we look towards accuracy measurement, the ratio of correctly classified instances (Japkowicz & Stephen, 2016), as a common starting point. We define correctly classifiedinstancesasactuallabeledyinputstobethesameaspredictedyinputs. Additionally, we will employ Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss (Kingma & Ba, 2017). BCE loss measures the difference between predicted probabilities and actual class labels, and it's often used during model training as a loss function to minimize classification error. Wewillfurtherexploreclassifierscores(precision,recall,F1-score)forimbalanced classes (Sokolova et al., 2006) and consider confusion matrices (Powers, 2020) to gain deeper insights into our random forest model's performance. 2.5.3. Naive Model 2.5.3.1. Framework Twonaivemodelswereusedtohelpusgetatasteofthe problem. Forthefirstnaivemodel,weframedthequestionasapureclassification problem, combining the NLP result (the stock’s aggregated sentiment score) and the market information (exogenous information e.g., sector) to predict whether the closing price will be higher than the opening price. We also tried to first frame the question as a regression problem, where we use the NLP result, market information, and the opening price to predict the exact expected closing price of the stock. The predicted closing price will then be compared with the opening price to answer whether the price is expected to go up during the day. We believe by framing the problem in two ways, we will be able to test both classification and regression algorithms and make a more [PAGE BREAK] informed decision on how to approach the problem for subsequent modeling. A simple illustration of the logic flow of our naive model is shown below. 2.5.3.2. Implementation We used Py Caret as our naive model implementa- tion, which trains and compares across different machine learning models, and selects the one with the best accuracy after 10-fold validation. For the classification approach, the highest accuracy of 57.01% was obtained by an Ada Boost Classifier model. In comparison, the dummy model returned a 51.25% accuracy. The confusion matrix and the top 3 performing models are given below. [PAGE BREAK] For the regression approach, the highest accuracy obtained was slightly worse at 55.79%. However, we were able to confirm the importance of twitter sentiment on stock price movement. As shown in the feature importance plot below, the variable weighted_sentiment_score is the second most important feature among all, only falling behind the opening price but vastly exceeds the importance of other exogenous variables like the sector and the companies’ IPO year. This confirms the role twitter sentiment plays in dictating stock price movement and prompted us to fine-tune the sentiment evaluation and improve our model. 2.5.4. Models Tested 2.5.4.1. FBProphet FBProphet is a time series forecasting tool by Facebook Open Source. Besidesthetimeseriesofclosingpriceitself,FBProphetalsoallows us to use other non-temporal regressors to perform a multivariate prediction. In ourmodel,wetriedtopredictthenextday’sclosingprice,basedonthehistorical time series of: the closing price, the trading day’s opening price, stock-specific twittersentiment, newssentiment, andindustrysentiment. Wealsoacknowledge that there may be a “delay” in a tweet’s impact on the stock price, for instance when the tweet was posted between the closure of the previous day’s market and the opening of the present day’s market. Hence, for all sentiment-related variables, we included both sentiment scores on the day itself and the previous day. As an example, for Twitter sentiment, we use the following two variables as our regressors: • weighted_sentiment_score: Tweets’ weighted aggregate senti- ment on the trading day • weighted_sentiment_score_-1: Tweets’ weighted aggregate sen- [PAGE BREAK] timent from the previous trading day. Theresultswereobtainediteratively,forwhichthe FBProphetmodelisretrained everyday,withnewinformationadded. Toensuresufficienttrainingdatainitially, we start training the time series model on the 366 th trading day, which is equal to around 30% of all data. However, we did not witness a significant accuracy increase for later days as we accumulate a longer time series. We were able to obtain an overall testing accuracy of around 58.61% from our FBProphet model. 2.5.4.2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Our dataset inherently embodies a time series prediction framework, characterized by timestamps for each entry. In light of this temporal structure, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were selected for their capability to leverage sequential data. Various RNN architectures, including Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with attention mechanismsand Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM)networks,wereimplemented to capture the intricate patterns and features embedded within the dataset, ultimately aiming to predict asset prices. Our initial approach involved amalgamating data from all ticker symbols into a unified dataset. This merged dataset facilitated the collective analysis of categorical and numerical features. The training and testing datasets were then partitioned, with the training set sequenced to preserve temporal dependencies. Evaluation of the model on the test data revealed an accuracy of 55.68%. Subsequently, we pursued a more nuanced analysis by segregating the dataset based on individual ticker symbols. This approach unveiled distinct performance variationsacrossdifferentdatasets. Notably,themodelexhibitedhigheraccuracy (61.62%) for the Microsoft (MSFT) ticker symbol, while yielding lower accuracy (51.14%) for Tesla (TSLA).

To further elucidate the underlying dynamics, we explored alternative RNN architectures, including GRU and attention models. Despite variations in model complexity, the results remained largely consistent. This convergence suggested that performance trends were less influenced by architectural nuances and more by shared factors such as hyperparameters, initializations, and loss functions. Our emphasis remained on understanding the fundamental characteristics of the base model, with minimal fine-tuning deemed necessary. Incorporating sentiment accumulation strategies into the dataset yielded promis- ing results, with each model experiencing a modest increase in accuracy ranging from 1% to 2%. However, a compelling discovery emerged during feature impor- tance analysis. Contrary to expectations, sentiment scores exhibited uniform weightage alongside other inputs, implying that they were not predominant factors driving model predictions. This revelation prompted a reevaluation of our approach, signaling the need for alternative methodologies to enhance model accuracy and efficacy. [PAGE BREAK] 2.5.4.3. Linear Regression Inourpursuitofmodelingtemporaldata,Linear Regression emerged as a candidate worthy of exploration. Employing various methodologies,including Support Vector Machines(SVM)and Huber Regression, we sought to evaluate their predictive accuracy. Initially, we assessed the performance of these models on a merged dataset, where all ticker symbols were consolidated. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) for Linear Regression was 0.713, for Huber Regression it was 0.686, and for SVM it was notably higher at 78.24. These results provided an initial glimpse into the models' efficacy in handling the combined dataset. Subsequently, we conducted a more granular analysis by splitting the dataset based on individual ticker symbols. For instance, for the AAPL_data.csv, the MSE for Linear Regression was 2.373, for Huber Regression it was 2.371, and for SVM it was 25.05. Despite achieving high accuracies ranging from 88.06% to 98.50%, it became evident that the models' performance varied across different datasets. [PAGE BREAK] Furtheranalysisrevealedthedominanceofthe'Open'pricefeatureininfluencing predictions, indicating a misalignment with our goal of leveraging sentiment scores for price prediction. Attempts to de-emphasize the 'Open' price and prioritize sentiment scores led to a drastic increase in MSE and a decline in accuracy. For instance, excluding the 'Open' price feature resulted in significantly higher MSE values (Linear Regres- sion: 163.64, Huber Regression: 162.11, SVM: 158.94) and reduced accuracies (Linear Regression: 50.75%, Huber Regression: 47.76%, SVM: 52.24%). [PAGE BREAK] Split Dataset Merged Dataset Split Dataset without ‘Open’ Model (MSE) (MSE) (MSE) Linear Regression 0.713 2.373 163.64 Huber 0.686 2.371 162.11 SVM 78.24 25.05 158.94 From the above table, the findings underscore the challenge of reconciling model objectives with feature importance. While Linear Regression demonstrated high accuracy, its reliance on 'Open' price undermined the incorporation of sentiment scores. This highlights the need for tailored approaches that strike a balance between feature relevance and predictive performance, paving the way for more nuanced modeling strategies. 2.5.4.4. Random Forest Thechoiceofutilizing Random Forestasourmodel was inspired by a reference project on a Git Hub repository by Anubhav Anand on his stock market prediction using sentiment analysis project. In his project, by utilizing Random Forest, he successfully achieve the accuracy of 91.96% on United Airlines stock. We utilized Apple stock for this experimentation. Firstly, we ran the base model of random forest taking in account weighted_sentiment_score, Open, Close, Low, High, news_sentiment, industry_sentiment as features and the output will be an indicator of 1 or 0. An indicator of 1 will signal that the closing price is greater than the opening price, and an indicator of 0 will signal otherwise. [PAGE BREAK] Our test result for the base random forest model is as shown: As well as the confusion matrix: Wealsoexperimentedwiththetrainedrandomforestmodelontheoriginaltrain dataset. The results is as follows: As well as the confusion matrix: [PAGE BREAK] Analyzing the results of how well the model performed with the train data and test data, we hypothesize that the model is overfitting on the train data. The huge difference in accuracy of train data (98.60%) and test data (59.72%) shows that the model does not perform well with unseen data.

Following the search, we found the best performing parameters: Best Hyperparameters: {’bootstrap’ : True , ‘max_depth’ : None , ‘max_features’ : ‘sqrt’ , ‘min_sample_leaf’ : 1 , ‘min_sample_split’: 2 , ‘n_estimators’: 100} Evaluating the performance of the model under these hyperparameters, we can see an improvement of robustness of the model.

With the a smaller difference between the accuracy of test and train data as compared with the base model without hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, we see a significant increase in the performance of the model from 59.72% to 90.28%. Next we evaluate the feature importance of the model: [PAGE BREAK] As seen in the chart above, we gladly see the weighted_sentiment_score has the biggest importance, which supports our initial hypothesis that twitter sentiment does play a part in the stock market. 3. Results and Discussion In this paper, we experimented with multiple machine learning models and our 2 highest performing models are Linear Regression and Random Forest. But looking at the feature importance chart of the Linear Regression model, twitter sentiment does not play a big part when predicting the stock movement, whereas for the Random Forest model, we see a significant improvement in both robustness and performance after hyperparameter tuning. And we can see that twitter sentiment does play a part in predicting stock movement in the Random Forest model. Acknowledging a limitation that we have in our dataset is there is an imbalance in the 1 s and 0 s as we can see in the bar chart below for Apple Stock: [PAGE BREAK] Although our best performing Random Forest model has the potential of pre- dicting stock prices with a relatively high accuracy, this limitation would hugely influence the credibility of our model. We would like to acknowledge that there are plenty of approaches when tackling thisproblemandourapproachmaynotbethebestway. Tofurtherevaluateand create a model that is able to predict stock market movement with a credible accuracy,wewouldhavetoexperimentwithmultipleotherapproachesintackling this problem as well as other machine learning models which we did not manage to explore given our time constraint. But in this paper, we can conclude that twitter sentiment does play a part in predicting stock market movement as we can observe in the feature importance chart. References Mehtab,S.,Sen,J.(2019).

Singapore University of Technology and Design 60.002: AI Applications in Design Dr. Kwan Wei Lek, Dr Edwin Koh, Mr Michael Alexander Reeves February 26, 2023 [PAGE BREAK] Generative Design of Electric Vehicle Additive Manufacturing (EVAM) Suspension Rocker Electric vehiclesarebecomingamorepopularchoiceinrecentyears,withanincreaseof40% in 2022(Powell,2023).Ingeneral,thesevehiclesarecomparativelymoresustainablecomparedtothe conventional combustion engine, simply because they do not produce harmful carbon emissions. Additionally, most vehicle charging stations use renewable energy. Similarly, manufacturing has continually been improving by creating a smaller carbon footprint through using eco-friendly materials. At the forefront of design and innovation, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) is manufacturing components for their electric vehicle project, known as Electric Vehicle Additive Manufacturing (EVAM). As the name suggests, they employ fabricating methods such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) and Stereolithography (SLA). In this project, we will be exploring the use of generative design tools to propose practical solutions that can promote material and energy savings. We will be focusing on the Electric Vehicle Additive Manufacturing (EVAM) suspension rocker. Methodology Firstly, we had to understand the loadconstraintsofthe EVAMrocker.Forthis,weneededto map out the component’s function within the mechanism of the system, whichhasbeendrawnoutin Figure 1. Figure 1 Illustration of the EVAM Rocker Mechanism [PAGE BREAK] The purpose of this mechanism is to stabilize the control of thevehicleandincreasecomfort in the vehicle (Universal Technical Institute, 2021). This can be illustrated in the stages of motion when the vehicle travels over a bump. In the first stage when the wheel first hits thebump,thereisanupwardforceonthewheelof the car. This pushes the suspension rod upwards at a 55 degree angle to the vertical. Through the rocker, the force is translated to a downward force onto the coil spring. This first stage is illustrated using the green arrows. The second stage is when the wheel fully travels over the bump. The suspension coil spring exerts a force back on the rocker. The rockertranslatestheforcebackontothesuspensionrod,which pushesthewheelbackintotheground.Thismaximizesthecontactofthetireswiththeground,sothat traction can be kept, and the driver will not lose control of the car. This is illustrated by the red arrows. Within thesetwostages,therockertranslatesthedirectionsoftheforces.Thisisillustratedby the pink arrows, as the rocker rotates about the axis (pink dotted line). Loads and Constraints Figure 2 Illustration of loads and constraints Next, we needed to interpret our force analysis from Figure 1 into the generative design software that we would be using, which is Autodesk Fusion 360. A generative study was created as seen in Appendix A. The generative study requires preserve geometries and obstacle geometries. The preserve geometries are the structures that will hold pins that are attached to the suspension rod, coil spring, and main chassis.Meanwhiletheobstaclegeometriesareforthesepinstogothrough.Thecomponent is then sandwiched by two more obstacle geometries so that its width does not increase. [PAGE BREAK] The design of mechanical systems often requires the use ofconstraintstoachievethedesired motion or behavior. In the case of the rocker and connector bearing support, a pin constraint and a fixed constraint were used according to the specifications provided in the design information. The fixed constraint was applied to the largestholeintherockertopreventanymovementwhileallowing it to act as a hinge, while the pin constraint was appliedtothebearingsupporttopreventdeformities in the radial and axial directions. The pin constraint on the bearing support allowed for movement in response to the force being applied on the other hole by the pushrods, while preventing undesirable deformities. The pushrods werefoundtobeexertingaloadof5000 Natanangleof55 degreesfromthevertical,which required careful consideration of the constraints to ensure proper function of the system. By using textbook constraints and following the design information, the system was able to achieve the desired motion and withstandtheappliedforces.Theproperuseofconstraintsisessential in mechanical design to ensure safe and reliable operation of the system. Materials In order to generate design alternatives for evaluation, we decided tovarythematerialofthe generative design study. We narrowed down the materials down to Aluminium Al Si (10 Mg), Cobalt Chrome, Inconel 718, Stainless Steel 17-4 PH, Titanium 6 Al-4 V, from the Fusion 360 Additive Material Library. We chose Inconel 718 and Stainless Steel 17-4 PH from their other variants of Inconels and Stainless Steels because both materials have better properties in general, in terms of yield and tensile strength, density and cost. We are aiming to settle for materials that have the highest yield and tensile strength, lowest density in order to minimize its weight contribution to the vehicle, and lowest cost for better manufacturing. Although Inconel 718 has lower ultimate tensile strength than its other 2 variants (Inconel 625 and Inconel 718 plus), it also has the lowest density and highest yield strength, whilst being cheaper. The Stainless Steel that we picked (Stainless Steel 17-4 PH)haslowerdensity,higher yield, and higher tensile strength as compared to its alternative (Stainless Steel AISI 304) in the Fusion 360 Additive Material Library (Ansys Granta, 2019, 2). Since wearedesigningarockerfora formula 1 themed electric vehicle, although Stainless Steel17-4 PHismorecostly,thebenefitsofthe material being light and strong exceeded the drawback of the cost of the material. From there, we performed a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) on these materials to assess and understand the environmental impacts in each stage of the material’s life cycle. This is important in order to be inline withtheproject’sgoalofsustainabledesign.Inthiscase,wefocusedonthemassof carbon dioxide (CO2) produced during material extraction, component fabrication, and component recycling.Thisisbecausethebenefitofanelectricvehicleisthatitdoesnotrelease CO2 whileinuse. To simplify the analysis, we had to make some assumptions: (1) No CO2 is produced in use andduringdistributionofcomponents,asthecomponentswillbe manufactured in-house. (2) Data will be collected from Casting CO2, due to lack of information about CO2 producedin additive manufacturing [PAGE BREAK] The LCA can hence be summarized in Figure 13, with additional LCA charts and graphs in Appendix A.

However, the different materials used in formgenerationwillusedifferent volumesofmaterial.Hence,weneedtofactorinthevolumeofmaterialusedinordertodeterminethe actual total CO2 produced. We also researched material cost for our evaluation to optimize the design from a business perspective. The cost of the Aluminium A1 SI (10 Mg), Cobalt Chrome, Inconel 718, Stainless Steel 17-4 PH, Titanium 6 A1-4 V, and the original Aluminum 7075-T6 are (in SGD per m3) is 8.08 e3-9.46 e3, 3.88 e5-5.26 e5, 1.47 e5-1.69 e5, 2.81 e4-3.22 e4, 1.2 e5-1.43 e5, and 1.66 e4 - 2 e4 respectively (Ansys Granta, 2019, 2). The product of the prices per unit volume and the volume of material used will then be used in our evaluation. Additive Manufacturing vs Die Casting While additive manufacturing is of the future, we took into consideration die casting aswell as it was one of the manufacturing methods offered in Fusion360. Using the default material, aluminum,wegeneratedtwomodelsusingthesetwofabricationmethods,asseenin Appendix B.The [PAGE BREAK] results show that the volume of material used in die casting is much greater than in additive manufacturing, due to the precision that it offers ascomparedtodiecasting.Thismeansthatadditive manufacturing will produce less CO2 than die casting as well. Control To aid in our evaluation, we set the control to be the original design fabricated using Aluminum 7075-T6, using milling. A simulation was conducted and the results are in Table 2.

Inconel and Titanium’s design is over engineered which also means it is too strong for the conditions the design is under, which signals wasting materials and cost. Figure 14 and 15 Example of Fusion360’s warning after running static stress simulations Further Evaluation We wanttoexplorehowthegenerateddesignwouldchangeifwevarythepresetsafetyfactor according to the previous results (table 3). We predicted that if wepresetthesafetyfactortoahigher value, the generated design would turn out to be over engineered and therefore having additional unnecessary mass and materials, and if we preset the safety factor to a lower value, the generated design would turn out to be fragile and would break under external forces. Therefore to further evaluate our designs, we tried to find the optimal preset safety factor value for each material, and generated a new design under changed preset safety factor as shown in table 4.

[PAGE BREAK] Engineering Perspective Engineering is concerned with designing the strongest structure, which we will be taking in consideration the material’s yield strength as well as each material’s generated design’s maximum stress data from the static stress simulation done on Fusion360. Material’syieldstrengthtellsushow much load the material can take before permanent plastic deformation. And maximum stress from Fusion360’s simulation workspace tells us what isthemaximumstressexperiencedbythedesignata certain area of the design. Therefore if the value ishigher,itwouldmeanthatahighamountofstress is focused on one point as all designs face the same loadsandconstraintswhileperformingthestatic stress simulation. Which also means that the design is not good at distributing thestressexperienced by it. To judge which material design isthestrongest,wewouldwantthatdesign’smaterialtohave the highest yield strength, and the lowest max stress value from Fusion360 as this will give us the design that is the strongest yet having a good stress distribution. Therefore we havecameupwithan equation 𝑌𝑖𝑒𝑙𝑑 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ − 𝑀𝑎𝑥 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠 in order to judge which design is the best from an engineering perspective. Table 7 Table of the results of𝑌𝑖𝑒𝑙𝑑 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ − 𝑀𝑎𝑥 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠of each material. Material Aluminium Cobalt Inconel Stainless Titanium Aluminum Al Si Chrome 718 Steel 17-4 6 Al-4 V 7075-T6 (10 Mg) PH (Original design) Yield 143.71 448.7 614.6 436.7 680.03 95.15 Strength - Max Stress (MPa) From the results in Table 7, Titanium 6 A1-4 V is the best choice of material from an engineering lens, as it has the highest high yield strength of 882.528 MPa. Though the lowest maximum stress is 49.85 MPa from Aluminum 7075-T6, it also has the lowest yield strength of 145 MPa, hence why it will not be the best option of material. Business Perspective From a business pointofview,wewanttoreducetheoverallcostofthematerial.Thiswillbe derived by taking the minimum cost per volume (SGD / m3), multiplied by the volume that was generated in Fusion360. From the data in Table 6, Aluminum A1 SI (10 Mg) has the lowest overall minimum cost at SGD 680,012.80. The next lowest minimum material cost would be Stainless Steel 17-4 PH which is at SGD 1,928,671.60, a largedifferenceof SGD$1,248,658.20.Withthat,interms of minimizing cost, Aluminum A1 SI (10 Mg) is the best option of material. Environment Perspective We want to reduce the overall CO2 produced by the materials, since increasedproductionof CO2 contributes more harm to the environment and people’s health. In Table 6, Stainless Steel 17-4 [PAGE BREAK] PH produces the least amount of CO2 at 6.69 kg/kg, therefore it will be the material chosen in consideration of the environment. Rankings To simplify our analysis, we used a ranking system to determine the best material in consideration of all 3 perspectives, asseenin Table8.Weassignedpointstoour6 differentmaterials, with 0 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. Table 8 Ranking of materials from engineering, business and environmental perspectives Material Aluminium Cobalt Inconel Stainless Titanium Aluminum Al Si Chrome 718 Steel 17-4 6 Al-4 V 7075-T6 (10 Mg) PH (Original design) Engineering 1 3 4 2 5 0 Business 5 1 2 4 3 0 Environment 1 4 3 5 2 0 Total Points 7 8 9 11 10 0 Recommendations With the rankings presented in Table 8, the best overall option of material will be Stainless Steel 17-4 PH, which ranked up the most points. The second best option will be Titanium 6 A1-4 V which ranked 10 points. Next in line will be Inconel 718 whichranked9 points,then Cobalt Chrome with 8 points, and Aluminum A1 SI (10 Mg) which is at 7 points. Lastly, there is Aluminum7075-T6 which performed the worst in all perspectives given that it has accumulated 0 points total. Though Stainless Steel 17-4 PH was not ranked the highest from an engineering point of view, in terms of sustainable development, it is the best. Itproducestheleastmassof CO2 emissions which is incredibly important in the modern world where there are serious implications of pursuing harmful practices that contribute to climate change. In developing for the long term where future generations are taken into consideration, it is the best decision to pursue a practice thatbenefitsboth the environment and business. In this case, because Stainless Steel 17-4 PHisthesecondcheapestin terms of cost, it will be greatforthebusinessastheycankeepmanufacturingwiththematerialwhilst being considerate to the environment and health of people. If we were to proceed with the best performing material in terms of strength, then Titanium 6 A1-4 V would be the option to go for. However, this will not be a sustainable choice as it is ranked the third lowest in terms of the environment’s perspective. It produces thethirdhighestmassof CO2 at 15.31 kg, which is a difference of 8.72 kg of CO2",

Summary of Lessons Learnt 1. The use of generative design can help identify new design possibilities that may not have been considered before. 2. In generating designs, we must use preserve and obstacle geometries in order to output desired outcome. 3. Failure to properly define project requirements and constraintscouldresultindesignsthatdo not meet the necessary specifications. Constraints are needed to achieve the motion or behavior needed. 4. Careful consideration should be given to the selection of materials based on their performance, cost, and sustainability. 5. In analyzing the sustainability factor of materials, a life cycle assessment is an appropriate method in identifying how much CO2 is being produced. 6. Testing and evaluation of the generative design outcomes is crucial to ensure that the design meets all project requirements and constraints. 7. An evaluation of the original design mustbeconductedinordertohaveabenchmarkthatthe generated designs can compare to. 8. Continuous improvement and iterationarenecessaryforrefiningthedesignandimprovingits performance over time. 9. Observing safety factors and stress levels is crucial to determine the design's real-life performance. A design with a low safety factor or high stress may not be reliable, requiring modifications. High values of safety factors can lead to over-engineering. 10. There are alwaysmultipleperspectivesinevaluatingtherightmaterialformanufacturing,and we should never rule outtheotherperspectivesinfavorofone.Andjustbecauseamaterialis the best performing, doesn’t always mean thatit’sthematerialthatshouldbepicked,because sustainability has become an important topic for consideration and we should start learning how to build with the future in mind.

We wanted to further break this down explore three types of Ensemble methods:\n(a) A base ensemble that simply combines predictions from sub-models (Text CNN and Bi RNN) and\nuses static aggregation methods to produce the final output.\n(b) An ensemble model with added attention mechanism that assigns weights to the sub-model\noutputs. The attention layer provides interpretability by revealing the importance of each\nsub-model's contribution to the final decision.\n(c) The same ensemble attention model as (b) but instead with custom embeddings into the\nframework. This is different from the other models that used the glove embeddings. These\nembeddings, such as positional or domain-specific features, enrich input data representations,\nenabling the ensemble to better align with task-specific characteristics. The attention\nmechanism leverages these enriched embeddings to assign more context-aware weights to the\nsub-models, resulting in more accurate predictions.\nWe have conducted experiments for all three. But the best outcome in the training set came from the\nensemble attention model with custom embeddings. With that, we have decided to focus on testing\nmore with this model.\nThe overall architecture is as follows:\n",

Task Type (SEQ_CLS) : The sequence classification setting aligns with our binary sentiment\n\nanalysis task of classifying movie reviews as positive or negative.\nThe pre-processing of data is also different from the original one presented in the final_project\nnotebook.\nThe initial data preprocessing pipeline, similar to our base model, applies several fundamental\ntechniques to both training and testing data. First, the text undergoes initial cleaning to standardize\nformat and remove unnecessary whitespace. Next, sentences are broken down into individual words\nthrough tokenization. Common words that don't carry significant meaning are then removed through\nstop word filtering. Finally, lemmatization converts all words to their base forms to reduce vocabulary\ncomplexity.\nAfter these core preprocessing steps, we leverage Ro BERTa tokenizers to convert the processed text\ninto numerical embeddings. These embeddings are crucial as they capture both word relationships and\ncontextual information within sentences. Ro BERTa's tokenization is particularly well-suited for\nsentiment analysis of movie reviews due to its ability to effectively handle informal language patterns\ncommonly found in user-generated content. It excels at processing emotional expressions and\nintensifiers (such as \"very\", \"really\", \"absolutely\") that are crucial for sentiment understanding. The\ntokenizer also maintains important contextual relationships between words, allowing it to capture subtle\nsentiment indicators that depend on the surrounding text context.\nTo train the model, we used the following constant configurations:\ntraining_batch_size: 16\nevaluation_batch_size: 32\ngradient_accumulation: 4\nlearning_rate: 1 e-5\nwarmup_ratio: 0.1\nweight_decay: 0.1\nThe following is the learning process:\n",

Manufacturing(EVAM)Interior Design At the forefront of design and innovation, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) is manufacturing components for their electric vehicle project, known as Electric Vehicle Additive Manufacturing (EVAM). As the name suggests, they employfabricatingmethodssuchas Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) and Stereolithography (SLA). As part of our 60.003 Product Design Studio, we have been tasked with designing the interior of the vehicle. Background Firstly, we would need to understand the current users’ needs for the vehicle. As thevehicleisstillinits testing stage, the users are mainly the engineering staff and students. To better understand future user needs, we conducted user (engineer) interviews, the AEIOU Observation Framework, and a Value Proposition. User Interview When we first viewed the vehicle, we prepared some questions for Senior Specialist Mr Liew Zhen Hui, to understand whattheyrequiredustodesign.Thiswasfollowedupwithquestionsto Mr Matthew Dylan Wong Jian Xiong for his vision and the concept for thecar.Thesequestionsandanswerscanbefoundin Appendix A. In summary, the concept of the car is to demonstrate additive manufacturing capabilities in the manufacturing of a race car. It should be designed to look‘dynamic,aggressiveandsporty’,withthe necessaryfunctionsrequiredforittobedriveninarace. AEIOUObservation Framework Next, weexploredthe AEIOU1 Observation Frameworkofthe EVAM.Amindmapofour AEIOUcanbe seenin Appendix B. Value Proposition Lastly, based on our User Interviews and AEIOU, a valuepropositionwasplannedtocategorisepossible needs into demands and wishes.Thedemandsarewhatwecanfullydesignwithinourtimelineandareof highestpriority.Theyareasfollows: 1. Dashboard. In order to enhance user experience, the users must be able to see all necessary informationaboutthevehicleatalltimes. 2. Steering wheel. To control more car settings for improved performance, the driver must be able to reachbuttons,whilestillfirmlyholdingthewheel. 3. Mobility. The users should be able to get into andoutofthecarwithease,regardlessoftheirheight orsize. On the other hand, wishes are additional features that we could provide. They can be foundin Appendix C.Astoryboardwasdrawntobettervisualisethevalueproposition,foundin Appendix D. 1 Acronymfor Activities,Environment,Objects,Interactionsand Users [PAGE BREAK] Design Brief Problem Statement Through our design process of empathise, define and ideate, we decided to design a means to enhance userexperienceoftheinteriorofthevehiclewithaddedlightness. Design Specification To accomplish our problem statement efficiently, we merged certain design wishes with the demands to createthreecohesivedesigngoals: 1. To design a dashboard, for both driver and passenger, that displays allnecessaryinformationatthe appropriate times, depending on its driving modes. These modes include static, demonstration and race mode. The telemetry must, at least, include Speed, Temperature of battery and motor, Battery Charge,andmustbeintuitive. 2. To design a steering wheel, with other controls besides steering input, for customizability of car functions. The design should be ergonomic so that the wheel is comfortable to hold and grip for prolonged periods, and also to reflect the SUTD identity onto the steering wheel design. Additionally,controlsshouldbeeasilyreachablebyfingers,evenwhenthedriverissteeringthecar. 3. To design a way for the trained driver and any able-bodied passenger to enter and exit thevehicle withease,regardlessoftheirheightsorsizes. Concept Development This means that although the final product is the interior of the goal, there is a need to design three separatecomponentsthatcanstillcomplementeachother. Functional Analysis Hence, in our concept development, there is a need to perform a functional analysis for the three components. Two types of analysis are the system and process perspectives, with the former shown in Figure1,andthelatterin Appendix E. [PAGE BREAK] Figure1 Functional Analysis System Perspectiveof Dashboard,Steering Wheel,Ingress/Egress [PAGE BREAK] Mood Board For the designofeachcomponenttocomplementeachother,thedesignsshouldbeinspiredbyacommon moodboard,asseenin Figure2. Figure2 Design Mood Board Additionally, a mood board was designed by DALL-E2. We wanted to use an AI-generated mood board for inspiration. However, it did not align with our vision so we didnotuseit.Thegeneratedmoodboard canbefoundin Appendix F. Concept Generation Using functional analysis, a morphological chart can be created to aid in concept generation, as seen in Table 1. However, due to the complexity of the vehicle, onlyfunctionsrelatedtothesethreecomponents willbeused. 2 DALL-E is an Artificial Intelligence System that generates images for text input, created by Open AI. (Johnson, 2021) [PAGE BREAK] Table1 Morphological Chart Concept Generation We selected and combined these functions to form our concepts.

[PAGE BREAK] Design Process Once the concepts were selected, we began the design process. This process consists of ideation, iterationsandfurtherdevelopment. Dashboard The dashboard could be split into two main components: user interface and screens. Each component wouldgothroughideation,iteration,anddevelopmentaswell. Screens Initially, therewereonlyplanstodevelopafrontdashboard.However,takinginspirationfromco-pilotsin fighter aircraft, a passenger dashboard was deemed necessary to assist the driver during races. Hence, a dashboard was required for driver and passenger, with each displaying different information. This information can be categorised into two categories: telemetry and camera views, which will be further elaboratedonunder‘User Interface’. The front dashboard only had a 360 by 140 millimetre space while the rear dashboard had a 200 by200 millimetre space. At therear,therewasalsomorespacebelowthecentralsupportbar,butthatareahadto be clear for the passenger to enter and exit the vehicle. Furthermore, only the upper section of the dashboard space could be used to narrow down the driver’s field of view, especially when he needs to focus on the track. Hence, we decided to use two 3.5-inch LCDs and one 7-inch LCD at the front, and five7-inch LCDsattheback. At the front, the dashboard holder was designed more aesthetically than functionally. Taking inspiration from wind tunnel flow visualisation (Hall, 2021), and our mood board, wavy lines were etched into the dashboard, with incrementing depths of two millimetres. These lineswouldcontinuetowardstheinterior side panelling of the vehicle.Thefrontscreenholderisalsotiltedfivedegreesupwardstoaccountforthe elevated height of the perspective of the driver. Similarly, the screens are tilted five degrees inwards to facethedriver.Anisometricviewofthisdesigncanbefoundin Appendix HFigure H1. To account for ease of manufacturing and theme of additive manufacturing, the screen holder had to be broken up to fit the 3 D Printer bed size. In the end, the dashboard was divided into two, with excess material trimmed for added lightness. A screen cover was added to seal the screen in the dashboard, as wellastohideanyexposedelectronics.Itsassemblycanbefoundin Appendix HFigure H2. At the back, we decided to implement adjustable screen holders. This is because unlike the user of the front seat, who is usually thesametraineddriver,theuserofthebackseatcanbeanyable-bodiedperson, regardless of his/her height. This means that different passengers may have different perspectives,hence the screen tilt must be different. Furthermore, as we chose to utilise the space below the central support beam for more screens as well, the screens should be able to tuck away so that itiseasierfortheuserto getinandoutofthevehicle. We based the design of theseadjustablescreensonmonitorstands.Thisusuallyinvolvesarmswithjoints or hinges that can be tightened or loosened. We simulated this design by 3 D printing arms, which were connected using M10 hex boltsandwingnuts.Thismeansthatthejointscouldbetightenedandloosened using the wing nuts. Similarly, the clamps that held the screen holders to thecentralsupportbeamofthe chassis could be tightened and loosened to provide a cylindrical joint for further adjustment by the passenger. While sharing with the engineering team about our design plans,theytoldusthattestersoftenholdonto the central support beam to steady themselves to counter the G-forces during acceleration and deceleration. This means that the initial plan for placement of screens wouldblockthesupportbeam.As [PAGE BREAK] we did not want to eliminate this, we decided to implement grips into the clamps. This would not only allow passengers to support themselves during high lateral forces, but also for ease in adjusting the clamp’s tilt. The final design can be found in Appendix H Figure H3, with its exploded assembly in Figure H4. The parts list for these dashboards can be found in Appendix H Table H1 while the fasteners usedarein Table H2. User Interface Due to the different modes, two different interfaces must be designed: Race and Demonstration. The codes for this (including all the connections of the user interfaces to the various components of the steeringwheel)canbefoundatthisrepository:https://github.com/Caitlin Chiang/EV-Screens Race. Inspiration was taken from F1 cars because the car concepts are similar: open wheel racing. Specifically, we took inspiration from the Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team, which displayed their wheel layout and the telemetry for each. The race driver would require telemetry such as speed, tyre/brake/motor/battery temperatures, battery charge,racedeltas,laptimings,brakebiasandmigration, race positions, laps done and drinking water remaining. Allthisdataiscolourcoded,withorangebeing too hot or almost depleted, blue being too cold or half used, and white being optimum temperature or full. The race-standard colours purple, green and white are used forracetimingsaswell.Thisissothat thedrivercaninstantaneouslytelliftheirbrakes/tyres/motor/batteryistoowarmorcold. As for the camera views, they were placed at the usual positions that therearviewmirrorswouldbein anordinarycar.Thisissothatitismoreintuitive. We tested the designs by printing out the interface onto paper the size of the actual screens. We then pasted them on the vehicle and tested how readable the interface is, as seen in Appendix I Figure I1. Initially,thefontsweretoosmallsoweincreasedthesizes.Additionally,wedecidedtoremovethefront facing camera as thespeedometerwastoolowandwasblockedbythesteeringwheel,sincethespeedis ofhigherimportancethanthefrontfacingcamera.

[PAGE BREAK] Steering Wheel The design process for our steering wheel began with a collaborative effort among team members, with eachcontributingtheirbestideastocreateaninitialconcept.Werefinedthedesignthroughtrialanderror, experimenting with specifications like size and button placement to achievethedesiredfunctionalityand aestheticswhichcanbeseenin Appendix JFigure J1 and Figure J2. However, we realised that we had overlooked important factors such as budget and manufacturing limitations, which led us to revisit the design and incorporate these factors. The iterations of steering wheeldesignscanbeseenin Appendix JFigure J3. To achieve a practical and cost-effective design, we began with a robust and lightweight aluminium chassis that provided structural support and stability. We carefully designed the chassis with cutouts for buttons and screws, ensuring a precise and secure fit for all components asseenin Appendix JFigure J4 and Figure J5. Another point to note is that, when we designed the steering wheel, we made sure to position the buttons in a way that would allow for easy access by the thumb for an average adult male. The button placements, as well as their functions can be seen in Appendix J Figure J6 and Table J1 respectively. The handles, buttons, and button shell were 3 D printed using advanced additive manufacturing techniques, allowing for a high degree of customisationandprecision.Thisreducedproductioncostsand lead times while also ensuring optimal functionality and aesthetics. The paddle shifters were designed with simplicity andeffectivenessinmind,featuringamicroleverswitchtowhichthepaddleattaches.We utilised a magnet instead of a traditional spring to provide haptic feedback, enhancing the tactile experiencefortheuser.Thelistoffastenersusedtoassemblethesteeringwheelcanbefoundin Appendix JTable J3. To cover the wires coming out the back of the steering wheel, we designed and 3 D printed a custom casing that also housed the paddle shifters. This provided a clean and professional look while ensuring thatthewireswereprotectedfromdamageandinterference. Overall, our steering wheel design incorporated a range of advanced manufacturing techniques and materials, from the precision-cut aluminium chassis to the 3 D printed components and custom casings. Every element was carefully considered and optimised for maximum functionality and user experience, resultinginahigh-performanceandaestheticallypleasingproductasseenin Appendix JFigure J7. Getting In/Out This particular aspect of the EVAM’s experience was rather tricky to enhance. Mainly because of the space constraints of the car’s interior,aswellashowthecarwasnotinitiallydesignedforaneasyingress and egress in mind. Both this obstacle has created a particularly awkwardwayfortheuserofthevehicle togetinandoutofthecarasillustratedin Figure3 below.

Furthermore, we had to understand what are the space constraints we are limitedtowithinthecar.Todo this, using Fusion 360, we modelled out the space inside the car, allowing us to know the exact measurements of space that we could work with. An illustration of the space constraint is shown in Appendix KFigure K2. [PAGE BREAK] After which we exploredmultipleideasasseenin Appendix KFigure K3,whicheventuallywerealisedis not very practical. One of the ideas was to lift the seatuptoacertainlevelthatwillbeeasierforusersto get into a sitting position first, then using some sort of mechanism to slowly lower the seat down and same for bringing the seat up.

[PAGE BREAK] Evaluation Budgeting For this project, we were given a budget of $1000 fortheproductionofourproduct.Wewillbebreaking down how much was spent in the making of each component in this section, as well as justification of why these purchases are necessary for our project. The detailedlistofhowmuchwasspentcanbefound in Appendix M. Dashboard A total of$737 ofthebudgetwasspentoncreatingthedashboard.Itwasparticularlyexpensivebecause of the display that is compatible with the raspberry pi module, that is necessary for us to showexactly whatitwouldlooklikeexactlyintheactualcar.Secondreasonbeingthatwewereconstantlyfacedwith the issue of not supplying enough power to the Raspberry Pi and its display. And soon later found out that for each screen and Raspberry Pi,itneededaseparatepowersourcewhichwethenneededtobuya charging plug for each display. For each screen, we also needed a SD card slotted into it for it to function. Therefore a part of the budget also went to the purchaseof SDcards.Otherthanthat,wealso intended 2 of our screens to display the live rear camera view in the car. Therefore we purchased 2 raspberry pi cameras to connect to the Raspberry Pi which eventually is able to display camera views onto the Raspberry Pi display that we purchased. Other than that, we purchased quite afewcablesthat are necessary to connectbetweenthe Raspberry Pimodule,thedisplay,andaswellasthepowersource. For each display, 1 x HDMI to HDMI cable, 2 x USB to micro USB cable is required. Thereforewith5 displays,weneeded5 x HDMIto HDMIcable,and10 x USBtomicro USBcable. Steering Wheel A total of $138 of the budget was spent on the production of the steering wheel. When creating the base metal plate of the wheel, we first attempted to purchase our own metal plate and cut it out in the Fabrication Lab (Fab Lab), but was soon met with the obstacle of it being too heavy and difficult in cutting precisely to scale. We then seeked help from an external source which provided us with alaser cutting service as well as a good lightweight material that is most suitable for our use case. Some amount ofthebudgetwasalsospentonswitchesthatwerenecessaryforustomakefunctionallybuttons in the steering wheel. We also spent some amount to purchase the screws and nuts that were not provided by Fablab mainly because it didn't have the length and size that we needed. Lastly, we purchased spray paints for the final finish of the steering wheel. Note that someoftheitemspurchased likeclayandnon-slipmatswerefortherapidprototypingphaseofthesteeringwheel,andwerenotused in the production final steering wheel. Finally, we also seek help from an external 3 D printing service fortheproductionofourbackcasingforbetter3 Dprintingfinishandquality. Product Weight As seen in Appendix H Table H1 and Appendix J Table J2, the total weight of fabricated products is estimated to be approximately 3.628 kilograms. This is below our design specification wish of five kilograms. This means that additional functionality would have a very minor dentontheperformanceof thevehicle. Client Feedback The client was particularly impressed with the seamless integration of the steeringwheelanddashboard. They felt that the design concept was innovative and unique, and appreciated the attention to detail that went into creatingacohesiveandaestheticallypleasingproduct.Theclientnotedthatthedesigncreateda more streamlined and ergonomic experienceforthedriver,whichtheyfeltwasasignificantimprovement overthetraditionaldesign. While the client was impressed with the overall design concept and integrationofthesteeringwheeland dashboard, they did have some minor critiques. The use of trial-and-error fordeterminingmeasurements [PAGE BREAK] was seen as a potential setback, as the client recommended the use of Anthropometric data for more precise results. Additionally, the client suggested modifying the line width and increasing the infill density for the 3 D prints in order to enhance the durability of the product, especially if it will be used whiledriving. Despite these minor setbacks, the client remained highly satisfied with the design and expressed excitementforthepotentialoftheproduct. Areasof Improvement Dashboard Due to the lack of time, more iterations of the screen holders could not be fabricated. The front dashboard holder should be designed to hide the Raspberry Pi. Similarly, the passenger dashboard should have a way to hide the cables that run out of it. Screen casings should be made, together with sealant, to weatherproof the electronics.

This way, the driver and passenger can operate more safely and with a better peace of mind, knowing that anything that goes wrong will be alertedbeforeincriticalcondition. Steering Wheel During the design and manufacturing process of our steering wheel, we encountered some challenges that revealed areas for improvement. Specifically, we found that our wiring management was lacking and our soldering skills needed improvement, resulting in a delicate final product.Additionally,the3 D printing process had some flaws that required workarounds. Furthermore, we were unable to complete the setup of the dashboard due to lack of planning and insufficientlylongwires,whichcausedconstant reboots. These challenges highlight the need for more comprehensive planning and better execution of manufacturingprocessesinthefuture. Gettingin/out Seeing how the rest of the components blend so seamlessly with the interior of the car. This particular component that is aiding the ingress and egress process for the user, specially seemed like a complete separatecomponentanddoesnotentirelyblendintotheinteriorofthevehicle.Therefore,morethoughts on how these side compartments could blend more seamlessly with thedesignoftherestoftheinterior ofthecomponentswoulddefinitelyimprovetheoveralldesignofthevehicle’sinterior. Also because this is one of the more obvious components when someone looks into the car, mainly because of its size compared to other components. We could also put more thoughts on how its functionality and aesthetic of the design of the sidecompartmentcouldbetterreflectthe SUTDidentity of being future-oriented, design-centric, and interdisciplinary. So that when visitors come and visit the EVAM, they are constantly reminded that this is specially produced by SUTD students and as well as the SUTDidentity. [PAGE BREAK] Reflection As mentioned in the client feedback, our group didnotuseprecisemeasurements.Thisledtoissuessuch asthebackcasingofoursteeringwheelnotfittingthebaseplateexactly.Assuch,wehadtofiledownthe back casing inordertofitittothebaseplate.Havingfacedthisavoidableissue,ourgroupnowknowsthe importanceoftakingprecisemeasurements,especiallyinthepreliminarystagesoftheproject. Our group also made use of Dall-E and Midjourney in our project to give us inspiration. While theydid help us make the design process easier, we understand that it is only a tool to aid us, and should not be used as a solution in itself. There is still the need for humans (i.e.ourgroup)togetinvolvedtotestouta design and see if it works for our project. This can be seen when we decided that the mood board provided by Dall-E did notsuitourvisionandthatwewouldnotwanttouseit.Anotherexampleiswhen we used Midjourney to give usdesigninspirationsforthefootrest.Westillhadtogodowntothevehicle and see ifthefootrestwasindeedabletobeimplemented,withtheconstraintmainlybeingtheamountof spacewehad.

Fordisplayinginformation,the LCDscreenswerechosenover Tablet Devicesastheywouldbetoo expensive, and over e-ink as it cannotrespondfastenoughforhighstresssituationssuchasracing. Lastly, a rocker switch was chosen over its other concepts because it gives a tactile sensation to startingandstoppingthecar,withtwoalternativeoptions:startandstop. Steering 1. Buttons were chosen over all other options for the steering as in a racing scenario, timing to obtain required information is extremely important, and buttons are the most effective in minimising the movement and time needed to obtain the desired dashboard information output, makingitthebestchoice.

We can also incorporate awavydesignintoitforaesthetics, whichiswhatwewantasshowninourmoodboard. 2.

We decided to use handles for the back seat as we observed that it is easier for drivers to push themselves upwards as compared to pulling themselves up by holding onto the chassis when gettingoutofthecar. 4. We have also implemented grooved heel rests for the front seat as during our investigation, we realised that there is a gap between the heels of the driver when their feet rests on the pedals, making it tiring to hold the driving position for long periods of time.
