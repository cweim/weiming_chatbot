**Optimising Rocker Design for Material and Energy Savings through Additive Manufacturing**

- Our task was to optimise the rocker component to reduce mass and energy usage.

**Approach:**

- **Physics Analysis:** We first studied the physics of the original rocker to understand its load-bearing requirements.
- **Generative Design:** Used Fusion 360’s generative design tools to create innovative rocker designs that meet the required loads and constraints.
- **Material Analysis:** Conducted material analysis to identify the best options for maximising energy and mass savings.
- **Life Cycle Analysis:** Compared the new and original designs, resulting in a 72% reduction in CO2 emissions.

## Results

---

### 60%

reduction in mass for the EVAM’s rocker component through the new design.

### 72%

decrease in CO2 emission for the EVAM’s rocker component through the new design.

## Final Product
