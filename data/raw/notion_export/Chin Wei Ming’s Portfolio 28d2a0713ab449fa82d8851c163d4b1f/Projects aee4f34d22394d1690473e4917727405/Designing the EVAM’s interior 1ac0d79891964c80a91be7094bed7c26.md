### **Interior Design for SUTD's EVAM (Electric Vehicle Additive Manufactured)**

**Objective:** Design the interior of EVAM, SUTD’s F1-themed electric vehicle, which arrived as a skeleton with no interior design. The goal was to address client concerns and reflect SUTD’s identity.

**Approach:**

- **Client Requirements:** Focused on issues such as ease of entry and exit, designing features like armrests and side compartments for both front and rear seats, and a leg and heel rest for the driver. These features included step platforms and handles to facilitate access for elderly passengers and children.
- **Design Development:** Over 14 weeks, our team produced a vision render for the EVAM’s interior and developed physical prototypes of the steering wheel, dashboard UI, and screens for both driver and passenger.

**My Deliverables**:

- **Design Solutions:** Addressed key issues by designing practical components to improve vehicle accessibility and comfort.
- **Prototyping:** Developed physical prototypes of the steering wheel, and passenger and driver screens.

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Emphasised the importance of storyboarding to effectively communicate ideas.
- Gained experience in hand sketching for initial ideation, producing numerous quick sketches to explore concepts.
- Created a mood board to establish the design tone, feel, and identity, ensuring uniformity across all components.
