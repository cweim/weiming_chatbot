**Addressing High Abortion Rates and Declining Birth Rates in Singapore**

**Objective:** Collaborate with Gebirah, a non-profit organisation, to tackle pressing issues related to high abortion rates, unsafe practices, and declining birth rates in Singapore. In 2020, there were 4,029 recorded abortions, averaging 336 per month, some involving underage girls. These challenges exacerbate the nation's aging population and endanger maternal and fetal health.

**Key Challenges:**

- **Access to Support:** How can we make it easier for women facing unplanned pregnancies to access personalised assistance, connect with professional counselors, and receive necessary emotional support without overwhelming or complicating the process?
- **Streamlining Services:** How can we streamline the handling of inquiries and prioritize cases effectively without compromising service quality or burdening administrators with complex features?

**Our Role:** With a team of six, we aimed to unify information from independent help centers and the government, providing a comprehensive support system for those in need. Our focus was on simplifying access to resources, improving case management, and ensuring the delivery of compassionate, effective care.

## Automated software testing system

---

Developed an automated testing system for both the client-facing phone app and web app to ensure functionality and reliability.

- Utilised Puppeteer in JavaScript to write test cases.
- Automated the testing process to verify that each component of the apps functions as expected.

The automated system enhanced the efficiency of testing, ensuring consistent performance across both platforms.
