The Expo MRT station, built over 20 years ago, no longer meets the needs of modern commuters, especially during peak hours. Our team reimagined the station's layout from an architectural perspective to enhance movement efficiency. We focused on optimising human traffic flow during peak periods.

I led the 3D modelling process, using Fusion 360 to bring our team's ideas to life. This involved multiple iterations to refine the design and address potential flaws. Once finalised, I developed the physical prototype. While our design may not be implemented, it serves as a valuable reference for future train station designs globally.

- Overcrowding and congestion during peak hours.
- Commuters colliding into one and another, was not ideal during Covid-19 period.

## Solutions

- **Split Platform**
