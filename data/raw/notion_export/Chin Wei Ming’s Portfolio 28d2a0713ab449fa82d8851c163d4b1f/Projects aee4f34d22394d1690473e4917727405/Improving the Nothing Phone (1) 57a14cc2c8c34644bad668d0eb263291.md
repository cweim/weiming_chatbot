## Data Pre-processing

---

**Data Cleaning:**

- Tokenization and lemmatization.
- Removal of stopwords, emojis, links, symbols, and duplicate comments.
- Lowercasing all text.
- Detection of language and translation to English.

## Data Analysis

---

**Sentiment Analysis:**

- Utilised Hugging Face Transformers to analyze and categorize reviews as positive or negative.
- Focused on extracting actionable product improvement suggestions from negative reviews, helping to pinpoint specific areas of concern raised by users.

**Topic Modeling:**

- Applied topic modelling techniques to classify comments into different categories, such as design, battery life, camera performance, etc.
- This helped in organising the feedback into meaningful themes, making it easier to identify trends and prioritise areas for improvement.

The project identified three **key design opportunities** for the Nothing Phone (1):

1. Establishing a **distinct identity** for the phone in the competitive smartphone market.
2. Introducing **different sub-models** with **varying specifications and price** to cater to diverse customer needs.
3. Designing a **new, innovative backing** for the phone to enhance its **aesthetic appeal and functionality.**
