To enhance urban planing through inclusive public engagement, I contributed to an **AI-driven application** designed for the **Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)**. This application streamlines engagement sessions by leveraging **generative AI** technologies to visualise **public feedback** as **actionable design insights**.

- AI-Powered Engagement: Integrated **Generative AI tools** (image inpainting, prompt upscaling, AI critique) to enhance public engagement quality.
- Interactive Public Engagement Platform: Developed a **user-friendly web application** that allows participants to visually express their ideas, submit feedback, engage with AI-generated urban design proposals in real time.
- Admin-Facing Platform: Designed and implemented an **admin dashboard** using **Figma for prototyping** and **React for front-end development**, streamlining the management of public input.
- User Testing & Evaluation: Conducted real-world trials comparing **traditional and AI-enhanced engagement methods**, demonstrating improved participant **satisfaction, engagement, and usability**.

## Problem Statement

---

How might we integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) to **enhance user engagement**, enabling users to **express desired space changes** and **distill actionable outcomes** from their feedback?

### **Current Challenges in Public Engagement**

- **Fragmented Workflow Due to Manual Toggling Between Applications**
- **Disconnection Between Public Feedback and Urban Design**
- **Difficulty in Translating Public Input into Actionable Outcomes**

## Solution

---

### **1. AI-Driven Public Engagement Platform**

- A web-based application designed to facilitate **seamless public participation**, allowing users to provide input on urban spaces through **text-based and visual interactions**.
- Uses **Generative AI** (image inpainting, prompt upscaling, and AI critique) to **translate user ideas into visualised design concepts**, helping participants see the potential impact of their suggestions.
- Users can **view and upvote** other participants' urban design ideas, fostering a **collaborative** highlighting the most popular community-driven solutions.

### **2. Real-Time Analytics & Insights for Urban Planners**

- **AI-powered analytics dashboard** that provides **real-time tracking and categorisation** of public feedback.
- **Automated trend analysis** to identify recurring themes, helping planners understand community priorities.
- Data visualisation tools that summarise public sentiment and preferences, ensuring feedback directly informs urban planning decisions.
