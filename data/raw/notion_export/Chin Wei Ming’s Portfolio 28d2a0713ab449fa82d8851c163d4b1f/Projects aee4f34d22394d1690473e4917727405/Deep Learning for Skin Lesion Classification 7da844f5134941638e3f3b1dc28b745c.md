## Overview

### **Deep Learning for Skin Cancer Detection**

**Objective:** Develop an AI model capable of detecting skin cancer with accuracy comparable to a doctor's expertise.

**Challenge:** With 99% of skin cancer cases being preventable if detected early, the goal was to create an automated and reliable system to identify the presence or absence of skin cancer in individuals using limited information.

**Outcome:** The project focused on leveraging advanced AI and deep learning techniques to ensure accurate and early detection, potentially reducing the incidence of skin cancer through timely intervention.

## Generative Adversarial Network

---

**Data Augmentation with GANs:** Explored Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate artificial images, increasing the training dataset. A separate neural network was trained to learn from real images and produce labeled artificial images.

## Grad-CAM

---

**Model Explainability with GRAD-CAM:** Leveraged GRAD-CAM to visualise the areas the model focuses on when making predictions. This approach enhances reliability, helping users trust the prediction results by providing transparency.
